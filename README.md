# Bootstrapping

This is a python code to bootstrap the from OIS discount factors from OIS market quotes. OIS quotes for the EUR market refer to the EONIA (or the EURO Overnight Index Average) rates, and those for the USD market to the Fed Funds Rate.

The bootstrapped zero rates/discount factors could then used for Swap valuations, or as in my case, for Proceeds XCCY Swap valuations.
